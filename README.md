You can find our plugin in the Jetbrains plugin repository by going to Settings -> Browse Repositories, and searching for Navigation wheel plugin.

<a name="usage"></a>
# Usage
- For opening wheel and running code analysis press alt + C + V. If opened files contain errors then it will be circled using another color (for Darcula - light gray, for others - pink). Code analysis is not fast operation so use this key combination only if you want to know is where errors or not.
- For opening wheel only press alt + C + X.
- If mouse cursor is placed on circle segment, animation will be shown with chosen file.
- To open file just click in circle segment or on button with file name.
- Move file out of the wheel to open file in the new window.
- Press “x” to remove file from navigation wheel.
- To close wheel without any action click in the centre or outside the circle.
